🧮 How It Works

The Sudoku grid is dynamically created using JavaScript and DOM elements.

Each cell can take a value between 1–9.

The Check button validates:

Duplicates in rows

Duplicates in columns

Duplicates in 3×3 subgrids

If all cells are filled without errors → 🎉 “Sudoku complete!” message appears.

🎨 Styling Highlights

CSS variables for colors, spacing, and sizing.

Grid-based layout for both board and controls.

Smooth hover and focus transitions.

Fully responsive — works well on desktop and mobile.

🧰 Technologies Used

HTML5 – structure and semantics

CSS3 – responsive and modern design

JavaScript (ES6) – game logic and DOM manipulation

🧑‍💻 Future Improvements

Add a Sudoku puzzle generator / solver

Implement difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)

Add timer and score tracking

Support pencil marks and undo/redo
